# Build Your Own AI Applications

Interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence? Learn these skills and get practical experience during this hands-on workshop.

The workshop is designed to help you become a data innovator by covering some of the technology that is required for Machine Learning and AI. Whether youâ€™ve been a data scientist for years or are just getting started, experts from IBM Cloud will be on hand to help you become a next-level application builder.

Bring your laptop to learn about AI technologies, their functions and use cases. You learn about designing intelligent products using Node-RED, building chatbots with Natural Language Processing and Watson Assistance and building a Visual Recognition application.

The workshop is for developers with basic programming skills who are curious about how to build AI into their own applications.

# Getting Started

## IBM Cloud

The first step is to sign up for an [IBM Cloud account](https://console.bluemix.net).

## Node-RED

Next create a Node-RED instance.
1. Log in to your [IBM Cloud Account](https://console.bluemix.net/)
2. Go to the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/)
3. Search for `Node-RED starter` and click the option to start creating a Node-RED instance
4. In the `App name:` field, enter a unique name for your Node-RED instance. Remember, the name will be used in part to form the URL that you'll use to access your Node-RED instance, make sure to take note of it _or_ make it easily memorable
5. Once you've entered your unique name, click "Create" in the bottom right of the screen.
6. The Node-RED starter instance will now be created and spun up. Once the process is complete the status of the application will change from "Starting" to "Running". When this happens, click the "Visit App URL" link to go to your Node RED dashboard.
7. You'll now be run through a quick 4 step initial setup process. 
    1. When prompted, do create a username and password for your Node-RED instance, this server will be publically accessible on the internet, and we don't want strangers digging around our lovingly crafted flows.
    2. Once you've entered a username and password, just click next until the process completes and you're taken to your Node-RED instance.
8. Click the "Go to your Node-RED flow editor" button to be taken to where we'll start creating our programs.

# Node-RED Introduction

If you are new to Node-RED this [tutorial](https://github.com/IBMCodeLondon/Node-RED-Watson-101/blob/master/README.md) will show you all need to know to get started. You will learn:

- The basic application of flow-based programming
- How to create a simple web server and pass messages between client and server
- How to use artificial intelligence APIs with your applications and data

Or sit back while we talk you through it all!
